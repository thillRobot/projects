    How to Make a Map with ROS and gmapping.

    Replace these things:

        <laserscan> your laser topic name
        <mapname> what you want you map to be called
        <robotip> IP address of the robot
        <remotecomputer> computer name of the control computer

    Also, some of these commands are specific to the robot (LX)


		1) Record the Laser data with a robot

   			i)  Turn on the navigation and mapping nodes

                $ roslaunch lx_2dnav lx_map.launch

			ii) Change to the directory where you want to save the data

                $ cd ~/ttu_ros

            iii) Start recording data

				$ rosbag record -O <mapname> <laserscan> /tf    *** This needs to be adjusted for your laser scan

			iii) Now, starting at the origin record a map by driving the robot using keyboard drive

                $ rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py

        	iV) close all processes from step 1, you should now have a file called <mapname>.bag



        2) Process the map data. Navigate to the directory where the data was saved in Step 1 for all the following processes.

   		    i) Turn on the ROS core

                $ roscore

            ii) Set the sim time param

                $ rosparam set use_sim_time true

		    iii) Turn on gmapping

                $ rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=<laserscan> _odom_frame:=odom

            iv) Now turn on rosbag and wait, it should tell you how long

		        $ rosbag play --clock <mapname>.bag

		    v) Once that is finished now you can save the map

		        $ rosrun map_server map_saver -f <mapname>



		3) Now you can close all processes, you should have a map call '<mapname>.pgm'. Try to use the map to navigate with AMCL.

            i) Turn on the navigation

                $ roslaunch lx_2dnav lx_navigate.launch map:=<mapname>

            ii) Now on a remote computer turn on rviz so you can drive the robot

                $ roslaunch lx_control lx_control.launch uri:=<robotip> host:<remotecomputer>


       4) Boom! Robots are fun!

below tested with lx on 02/14/2020
1) make a map with the LX again, a clean one hopefully.

		i) ssh thill@robot$ roslaunch lx_2dnav lx_drive.launch
		
		IN A NEW TERMINAL			
	 			
		ii) ssh thill@robot$ cd ~/ttu_ros
				   $ rosbag record -O labmap /RosAria/S3Series_1_laserscan /tf

		   Now, starting at the origin record a map using keyboard drive

	
		-> CLOSE BOTH PROCESSES		

		-> $ roscore

		-> $ rosparam set use_sim_time true
				
		-> $ rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=/RosAria/S3Series_1_laserscan _odom_frame:=odom

		-> $ rosbag play --clock labmap.bag

		-> WAIT FOR IT TO MAKE THE MAP

		-> $ rosrun map_server map_saver -f labmap

		-> NOW YOU CAN CLOSE ALL PROCESSES, you should have a map call 'labmap.pgm'	



		2) try to use the map to navigate with AMCL

		-> $ roslaunch lx_2dnav lx_config.launch

		-> $ roslaunch lx_2dnav lx_move_base.launch 

		3) now turn on rviz remotely

		-> $ roslaunch lx_control lx_control.launch
